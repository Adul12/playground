# Markov Decision Process

In this class, we discussed the Markov property, Markov Reward Process (MRP), and Markov Decision Process (MDP).

This exercise is meant to introduce you to openAI gym environment and clearly define the main elements of Reinforcement Learning in code.

We will be interacting with openAI gym's environments a lot so this activity will introduce you to the main components.

## Before you get started

Ensure you clone `gym_maze` by running:

```
git clone git@github.com:CSCN8020/gym_maze.git
```

And follow the instructions to set it up.

## Random Agent

The random agent here follows a random uniform policy to make decisions.

Although it does not have a way of learning yet, it introduces the concept of an environment, agent, action, state, and reward.

Feel free to play around with the code to get more familiar with it. This is why we called this repository the "playground".


### Note

The code was adapted from the Q-learning example in the original gym_maze repository: [here](https://github.com/tuzzer/ai-gym/blob/master/maze_2d/maze_2d_q_learning.py)
